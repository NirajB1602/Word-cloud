# Word-cloud
**Final Project in the Crash Course on Python: Word Cloud**
#
For this project, I'm going to create a captivating "word cloud" from a text by crafting a script. My script will handle various tasks, such as processing the text, eliminating punctuation, disregarding letter case, filtering out words that don't contain all the alphabet characters, calculating word frequencies, and excluding uninteresting or irrelevant words. The output of my script will be a dictionary generated by the `calculate_frequencies()` function. The word cloud module will then utilize this dictionary to generate the visually appealing image.

To get started, I'll need an input text for my script, which should be a file containing text only. I can easily source this text by copying and pasting content from a website I find interesting or by accessing online books through resources like Project Gutenberg. For example, I might explore word clouds generated from renowned literary works such as a Shakespearean play or a novel by Jane Austen. I'll save this text as a .txt file on my computer.

Next, I'll upload my input file here so that my script can process it. To facilitate the upload, I'll use an uploader widget. I'll execute the cell that includes all the necessary installations and imports for my word cloud script and uploader widget. It might take a moment for the installations to complete, and there will be several output messages. Patience is key here. Once I see the final output line, I'll know that the code has finished executing, and I can proceed with the instructions in this notebook.

To upload my text file, I'll run the provided cell, which contains the code for a custom uploader widget. After running this cell, a `Browse` button will appear below it. I'll click on this button and navigate to the location where I've saved my text file.

The uploader widget will save the contents of my uploaded file into a string object named "file_contents." This string will be the starting point for my word cloud script, and it will undergo further processing.

In the cell below, I'll craft a function that will iterate through the words in "file_contents," handling tasks like removing punctuation, counting word frequencies, and filtering out uninteresting words like "and" or "the." Additionally, it will be case-insensitive and ignore words that don't contain all alphabet characters. To streamline the process, I'll store the results of this iteration in a dictionary before passing them into the "generate_from_frequencies" function to create my unique word cloud. Happy word cloud creation!
